# Extension Icons

You need to add PNG icon files in the following sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Creating Icons

### Option 1: Use an Icon Generator
- Use a tool like [Icon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/) or [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
- Upload a square image (at least 512x512 pixels)
- Download the generated icons

### Option 2: Design Your Own
- Design in Figma, Sketch, or Adobe Illustrator
- Export as PNG at the required sizes
- Make sure the background is transparent (optional but recommended)

### Option 3: Use a Placeholder
- For quick testing, you can use any square images
- Just resize them to the required dimensions
- Chrome will display them in the extension UI

## Icon Design Tips

- Use simple, recognizable imagery
- Ensure good contrast and visibility
- Consider how it looks at small sizes (16x16)
- Use consistent styling across all sizes
- Represent the "study" or "AI" theme

## Suggested Design Ideas

- Brain icon with a lightbulb
- Book with AI/circuit elements
- Graduation cap with tech symbols
- Letter "AI" in a modern font
- Abstract learning/knowledge symbol
